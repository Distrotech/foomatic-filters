.SH NAME
lpdomatic \- Foomatic filter script for LPD, LPRng, and GNUlpr
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpdomatic
[\fIOPTION\fR]... <PPD-filename>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBlpdomatic\fR print filter serves as an input filter for the lp
family of print spoolers. The print spooler will use it if there is an
entry \fBif=@$ENV{'LPDOMATIC'}@\fR in the appropriate printer
section in \fI@$ENV{'PRINTCAP'}@\fR. You can generate such an entry
using foomatic-configure.

A listing of the attached printer drivers options is printed, when the
option \fBdocs\fR is passed to this filter.  This can be achieved by
issuing one of the following commands:
.TP
for LPRng use
\fBecho | lpr -Z docs\fR
.TP
for other spoolers
\fBecho | lpr -J docs\fR

.SS Options
.TP 10
.BI \-j \ option
(all but LPRng) Pass \fIoption\fR to the printer driver.  May also be
read from the environment.

.TP 10
.BI \-J \ jobtitle
(LPRng only) Set the job title to \fIjobtitle\fR.  This may be used
to set a title header when printing plain text.

.TP 10
.BI \-Z \ option
(LPRng only) Pass \fIoption\fR to the printer driver.
