2006-08-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-gswrapper.in: Support for built-in redirection of
	  standard output of PostScript programs ("-sstdout=%stderr") in
	  newer GhostScript versions. More reliable then using /dev/fd/3
	  (not always available difficult to check presence) or '|cat >3'
	  (not seekable and some GhostScript output devices require
	  seekability of the output file),

2006-07-10  Norm Jacobs <Norm.Jacobs@Sun.COM>

	* *: Removed executable permissions from source files which are
	  not executables

2006-06-15  Norm Jacobs <Norm.Jacobs@Sun.COM>

	* foomatid-rip.in: failing to open IPP attributes file shouldn't be
	  fatal

2006-06-01  Norm Jacobs <Norm.Jacobs@Sun.COM>

	* filter.conf: example of a preferred shell setting

	* foomatid-rip.in: detect and use a "modern" shell for shell commands

2006-05-17  Norm Jacobs <Norm.Jacobs@Sun.COM>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Add support for Solaris LP, made default echo,
	  fileconverter, and execpath setable through configure options.

	* foomatic-gswrapper.in: made default execpath setable through configure
          options

	* foomatic-rip-1.in: fixed to use @sysconfdir@ for configure

	* foomatic-gswrapper-1.in: fixed to use @sysconfdir@ for configure

	* configure.ac: made default execpath, fileconverter and echo setable
	  through configure options.  Generate man pages through configure

	* makeMan.in: removed, configure now generates the man pages

	* Makefile.in: cleaned up some to work with makes other than gmake

	* README, USAGE: added Solaris LP 

2006-01-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* beh.in: Fixed bug of N^2 copies being printed when N copies
	  were requested.

	* configure.in, configure.ac: Renamed configure.in to
	  configure.ac, to make the package working with the current
	  versions of aclocal and autoconf.

2005-11-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README, USAGE, beh.in: Updated documentation, to take into
	  account beh and HPLIP, dropped HPOJ in the documentation.

2005-09-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Better support for non-PJL JCLs. If there are
	  Foomatic options of execution style JCL, they are only prefixed
	  with "@PJL " if the PPD does not contain a "*JCLBegin:"
	  expression not containing "PJL" and if the prefix is not
	  changed by a "*FoomaticJCLPrefix:" in the PPD file. If there
	  is a "*JCLBegin:" without "PJL" and no "*FoomaticJCLPrefix:"
	  the JCL commands do not get any prefix. Fixed also bug of
	  $jobuser and $jobhost not being chomped.

2005-08-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* beh.in, configure.in, Makefile.in: Added the "beh" (Backend
	  Error Handler) CUPS backend. With this the handling of errors
	  of the CUPS backends (printer communication errors, like
	  printer not turned on) can be configured, instead of CUPS
	  simply disabling the print queue.

2005-07-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Added substitution of special XML entities by
	  job data, as date, time, job ID, user name, ... (in function
	  "unhtmlify()"). This was suggested by George Liu from Ricoh
	  (george dot liu at ussj dot ricoh dot com), to support jobs
	  with submission of login/password to the printer.

2005-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  checking whether the input file is DSC-conforming. They can also
	  be DSC-conforming (thanks to Kevin ODonovan, kevin dot odonovan
	  at nist dot gov, for his report); Let the "FontPath" defined in
	  /etc/cups/cupsd.conf being used when CUPS is the spooler
	  (thanks to Peter Kekesi, kekpeti at freemail dot hu, for his
	  report).

2005-05-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Added comment before the line to automatically
	  quote unquoted slashes in the allowed characters list or allowed
	  regexp.

2004-12-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Fixed bug of foomatic-rip replacing a JCL
	  command (ex: "@PJL HOLDKEY=1234") if another which is contained
	  in the first one is supplied (ex: "@PJL HOLD=STORE"). Thanks to
	  Jociel Cavalcante Andrade (jcainfo at inf dot ufes dot br) for
	  reporting the bug and testing the fix.

2004-12-04  Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Include -*- perl -*- for Emacs mode selection.

	* foomatic-gswrapper.in: Instead of testing for /dev/fd/*, use
	  them directly; this gets around some unreliability with
	  Ghostscript prefiltering that is described in Debian bug report
	  #271519 (http://bugs.debian.org/271519).  Also include -*- perl
	  -*- for Emacs mode selection.

2004-11-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Fixed problem of foomatic-rip crashing with
	  error 29 (ESPIPE = "Illegal seek") on "close STDIN;" on some
	  non-Linux platforms as Unixware 7.1.0, fixed problem of CUPS
	  page accounting PostScript code in foomatic-rip overriding
	  already exisiting /EndPage procedures. Added output of error
	  code when foomatic-rip dies. Thanks to Helge Blischke

2004-08-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: SECURITY FIX: foomatic-rip could execute
	  arbitrary commands as user "lp" (or however the spooler's
	  special user is named) on the print server. Advisory ID:
	  CAN-2004-0801.

	  The fixes:

	  - Let unprintable characters be removed from all command line
	    options and environment variables.

	  - Let shell escape characters be removed from file names, queue
	    names, driver options, and some other input strings.

	  - Let "open" commands for file access always use "<" or ">" to
	    specify reading or writing.
 	
2004-06-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

2003-11-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in, filter.conf: Added support for CUPS raster
	  drivers to foomatic-rip. Now CUPS raster drivers can be used
	  with every spooler.

2003-10-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Fixed bug of sometimes an extra blank page
	  being printed after the job.

2003-10-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added option "--disable-file-converter-check" to
	  disable checking whether there is a file converter installed.

2003-10-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added /usr/local/libexec to LIBSEARCHPATH for *BSD
	  compatibilty. Thanks to Sebastian Horzela (sh at horzela dot
	  com).
	
	* configure.in: For CUPS a2ps, enscript, or mpage is not needed,
	  here texttops of CUPS is used be default. So let ./configure
	  also check for texttops.

	* tests/Makefile.in: Continue testing when comparing the result of
	  a test with the reference file fails, give only a warning in
	  such a case.

2003-10-20  Patrick Powell <papowell@lprng.com>

	* added 'use strict' and -w to the Perl options.

	* fixed a large number of undefined or out of scope variable
	  references discovered by the 'use strict' and -w.

	* added 'use Cwd' to get current working directory

	* Modified foomatic-rip to auto-sense the LPRng configuration.
	  This eliminates the need for the --lprng option, unless you want
	  to use it.  You now set the ppd_file option in the printcap to
	  specify the location of the PPD file:

	  	lp:filter=/path/to/foomatic-rip
	  	  :ppd_file=/path/to/ppdfile
	   or
	  	lp:filter=/path/to/foomatic-rip --ppd=/path/to/ppdfile \
		[options]
	   or
	  	lp:filter=/path/to/foomatic-rip --lprng [options] \
		/path/to/ppdfile
		  (legacy documented foomatic method)

	  If you specify both, the command line overrides the :ppd_file
	  New versions of the LPRng 'checkpc' program will check for the
	  presence of the :ppd_file if it is specified.

	* Modified fomatic-rip to be less 'verbose' and not put out blank
	  lines when used with LPRng.  Changed 'dieing' to 'dying' in
	  error messages, as well as removing some typeos in other places.

	* Modified the configure.in, Makefile.in, and makeMan.in scripts
	  to use the current/latest autoconf conventions.  Using
	  ${INSTALL} to do installation and mkinstalldirs to create
	  directories.  Modified the configure script to NOT override the
	  use of sysconfdir.  You can now run the configure script from a
	  subdirectory.  This implies that your filter.conf file will now
	  be installed in ${sysconfdir}/foomatic/filter.conf, not in
	  /etc/foomatic/filter.conf.  The other foomatic installation
	  scripts should also be modified to follow this convention.

	* The configure script now checks for at least one page converter
	  (a2ps, enscript, mpage) and errors if one is not installed.

	* modified the code for 'echo' to be compatible with the comments in
	  foomatic-rip.  The filter.conf file can now set the echo program.
	
2003-09-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: When option settings on the last page of a job
	  changed and the last page was read completely into the FIFO
	  before it was printed, the renderer was not restarted to take
	  into account the option changes.

	  Added a new workaround for a new bug in the PostScript generated
	  by OpenOffice.org 1.1.0.

2003-08-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

2003-08-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Fixes on JCL header merging, support for nested
	  composite options.

2003-07-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: If a printer/driver combo has Foomatic-defined
	  JCL options and the driver already generates a JCL header, the
	  JCL options are merged into the header produced by the driver.

2003-06-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in, makeMan.in, foomatic-rip.in: Support for IRIX.

	* foomatic-rip.in: Updated comments.

2003-06-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Let "echo" commands in the renderer command
	  line being replaced by $myecho, so that printing on non-GNU
	  systems with user-selected GNU "echo" command works.

2003-04-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-filters 3.0.0rc2. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-filters-3_0_0rc2".

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.0rc2.

	* foomatic-rip.1.in: Added missing substitutions for special
	  characters in postpipe.
	
2003-04-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: added restriction for allowed strings by means
	  of lists of allowed characters (PPD keyword:
	  '*FoomaticRIPOptionAllowedChars <option>: "..."') and Perl
	  regular expressions (PPD: '*FoomaticRIPOptionAllowedRegExp
	  <option>: "..."'). The allowed characters are checked by a
	  '/^[...]*$/' expression in the Perl scripts, so ranges with '-',
	  forbidden characters with a leading '^', or special characters
	  as '\w', '\d', '\x07', ...  are allowed. Regular expressions are
	  applied via a '/.../' expression. These restrictions are done
	  for security reasons, to avoid for example a string like "|| rm
	  -rf * ||" in a command line option.

	  The string 'None' is always mapped to the empty string,
	  as PPD files and the command of some spoolers do not accept an
	  empty string as argument value.

	  Several bug fixes done for the string options.

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-filters 3.0.0rc1.

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.0rc1.

2003-04-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Introduced string and password options.

2003-04-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Currently, the renderer is re-started whenever
	  an arbitrary option is changed from one page to the next one.
	  For PostScript options this is not really needed when one resets
	  the PostScript state from before the beginning of the page. Done
	  tests with saving the state before and restoring it after every
	  page, but this did not work as the "showpage" cannot be bracketed
	  by "(g)save"/"(g)restore". See Adobe's "PostScript Language
	  Document Structuring Convention (DSC) Specification Version 3.0"
	  (http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/technotes/postscript.html),
	  section 4.3, "Use of showpage" (p. 26). Problem is that "showpage",
	  "(g)save", and "(g)restore" are often in macros/subroutines, so
	  they are not easily visible so that one can easily insert option
	  settings or saving/restoring of the PostScript state at the correct
	  place. So for now inserting saving/restoring lines is commented out
	  in foomatic-rip and the renderer is restarted at every option
	  change ("optionsequal(, , , 0)") and not only after changes of
	  JCL or command line options ("optionsequal(, , , 1)").

	  Fixed bug of Prolog and DocumentSetup sections created by
	  foomatic-rip when first "%%Page: ..." is found not being added
	  to the PostScript header data .
	
2003-04-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Added support for applying options only to
	  selected pages via the command line. Now options can be
	  preceeded by a page specification:

	  CUPS, GNUlpr, CPS, no spooler:
	    lpr -o 1:InputSlot=Letterhead
	    lpr -o even:Watermark=on
	    lpr -o 1,6-10,15,20-:MediaType=YellowPaper

	  LPRng:
	    lpr -Z 1-2:MediaType=Cardboard

	  LPD:
	    lpr -J "1,6-10,15,20-:MediaType=YellowPaper"

	  PPR (RIP):
	    ppr --ripopts "1:InputSlot=Letterhead"

	  PPR (Interface)
	    ppr -i "1:InputSlot=Letterhead"

	  The syntax is "even", "odd", or giving comma-separated page
	  numbers or page ranges. Applying options to selected pages with
	  PDQ is not supported.

2003-03-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Workaround for bug in OpenOffice.org.
	  OpenOffice.org puts "%%BeginSetup...%%EndSetup" section with
	  option settings valid for the whole document after the first
	  "%%Page:..." line. So without the workaround all settings made
	  with the "Properties" button in the "File"|"Print" dialog
	  applied only to the first page, the other pages were printed
	  with the printer's default settings. Fixed also some typos.

2002-11-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, makeMan.in: Updated Makefile
	  infrastructure to let the package correctly build the man page
	  and link foomatic-rip into the filter directories of CUPS and
	  PPR.

	* foomatic-rip.in: Allow more than one occurence of the same spot
	  ("%A", "%B", ...) in the RIP command line prototype, so that one
	  option setting can act on several points of the command line
	  (was an old TODO point of Grant).
	
	* foomatic-rip.1.in: Continued working on the man page for
	  foomatic-rip.

	* foomatic-gswrapper.in: Fall back to "| cat >&3" and "-" instead
	  of "/dev/fd/3" and "/dev/fd/0", if the file descriptor directory
	  /dev/fd does not exist.

	* README, USAGE, TODO: Updated the package documentation.
	
2002-11-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Added instructions for using a custom page size
	  to the documentation page output ("-o docs") for the PPR RIP
	  mode of foomatic-rip.

	* src/*.in, src/Makefile, lpdomatic.8.in, directomatic.1.in:
	  Removed the old spooler-specific filters, they are replaced
	  by foomatic-rip now.

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Removed stuff to build the old
	  src/*omatic filter.

	* foomatic-rip.1.in: Added man page for foomatic-rip.

2002-11-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Various fixes and adaptations to make
	  foomatic-rip well working together with the new
	  foomatic-configure:

	  Support for raw queues under all spoolers and spooler-less
	  printing.
	
	  When foomatic-rip is used as a PPR RIP, it accepts also options
	  through the new "--ripopts" option of the "ppr" command of PPR
	  1.50 now.

	  Accept "-o <option>=<value>" on the command line also when one
	  uses foomatic-rip as a PPR RIP, so one can easily set defaults
	  using

	   ppad rip <printer> foomatic-rip x -o <option>=<value> -o <switch>


	  Fixed bug which broke renderer command lines composed from
	  several shell commands in debug mode.
	
	  Read Foomatic IDs from the PPD file.
	
	  Make default configuration file for spooler-less printing being
	  /etc/foomatic/direct/.config and PPD files being searched in
	  /etc/foomatic/direct.
	  
	  In debug mode debug logging is started in the beginning of the
	  parsing of the command line options, right after checking the
	  options relevant for logging.

2002-11-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Added legacy interface for old Foomatic 2.0 PPD
	  files. Now foomatic-rip accepts all PPD files except the ones
	  for native CUPS drivers.

	  Fixed output of sample command line in the help page generator,
	  also do not display options with only one choice on the help
	  page.

	  Do not range check numerical options when building the command
	  line, we did it already when obtaining the option settings from
	  the command line, the PPD file, and the job data.

2002-11-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Now all spoolers, including PDQ, are supported
	  and tested successfully. With foomatic-rip all spoolers can be
	  used with PPD files now, either PPD files supplied by printer
	  manufacturers for their PostScript printers or Foomatic (2.9.x)
	  PPD files.

	  Added "buildpdqdriver()" function and "--genpdq"/"--appendpdq"
	  command line options to build PDQ driver declaration files which
	  call foomatic-rip for the dirty work and offer all options
	  available in the PPD file to the PDQ user. They accept all file
	  types, so PostScript and all, what the file conversion filter in
	  use ("a2ps", "enscript", "mpage") understands, can be printed.

	  Setup of a printer under PDQ as follows:

             cp foomatic-rip /usr/bin
	     cp myprinter.ppd /etc/foomatic (or ~/.foomatic/)
	     chmod 666 /dev/lp* (or /dev/usb/lp*)
	     foomatic-rip -P myprinter \
	        --genpdq /usr/lib/pdq/drivers/misc/myprinter.pdq
	     xpdq (set up the printer, right-click -> "Add Printer")

	  The first three lines are the same as for spooler-less printing.
	  In The "foomatic-rip" line one can add options (with "-o") to
	  change the defaults in the PDQ driver declaration file.

	  Improvements on documentation page generation: Support for "-o
	  switch"/"-o noswitch" for boolean options. Minor text
	  corrections.

2002-11-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Now all spoolers (except PDQ) are tested
	  successfully.

	  Added support for foomatic-rip running as a PPR
	  RIP (PPR 1.5x), before it could only run as a PPR interface. To
	  use it as a PPR RIP one sets up the print queue as follows:

	     ln -s foomatic-rip /usr/lib/ppr/lib/
	     ppad interface foo parallel /dev/lp0
	     ppad ppd foo /path/to/foo.ppd
	     ppad rip foo foomatic-rip other x

	  (the "x" in the end of the last line is needed to work around a
	  bug.)

	  Use "PPR_VERSION" environment variable to auto-detect whether
	  PPR is the spooler.
	
	  The parsing of the command line options did not work with the
	  Getopt::Long Perl library when using LPRng as the spooler.  The
	  problem is that LPRng uses short options (one hyphen and one
	  letter) and lets the argument follow without space
	  ("-ZPageSize=A4"), on this Getopt::Long chokes.  Replaced
	  Getopt::Long by a self-made method to parse the options.

	  Prepared foomatic-rip for PDQ support.

	  Added comment about the supported spoolers.

2002-11-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: The basic functionality of foomatic-rip is now
	  implemented, all features of the old "*omatic" filters are also
	  available in foomatic-rip.

	  Now text and other non-PostScript files can be printed,
	  foomatic-rip calles "a2ps", "enscript", or "mpage" automatically
	  when it detects a non-PostScript file.

	  Improved command lines of "a2ps", "enscript", and "mpage" to
	  generate wider margins (so that nothing gets cut off) and
	  wrapping of too long lines (to not loose information).

	  The "docs" option lets a help page being printed, independent of
	  the file originally sent. This works also with manufacturer-
	  supplied PPD files of PostScript printers. CUPS prints the
	  documentation page with its native "texttops" filter by default,
	  but this can be changed to "a2ps", "enscript", or "mpage" with
	  "textfilter" line in /etc/foomatic/filter.conf.

	  Custom page sizes work also on manufacturer-supplied PPD files
	  now,

	  Fixed control of quiet, verbose, and debug mode from the command
	  line ("-q", "-v", "--debug").
	
	  foomatic-rip used without spooler does not have any console
	  output any more (except error messages). Use the "-v"
	  ("Verbose") for log output on the console and "--debug" for
	  debug log files.
	  
	  Debugging files are now /tmp/foomatic-rip.log (log file) and
	  /tmp/foomatic-rip.ps (PostScript data pre-processed by
	  foomatic-rip, as it is stuffed into the renderer).

	  When using CUPS as the spooler, lists of the command line
	  options with which foomatic-rip was called are only written to
	  the log when in debug mode, so that Mac OS X does not produce
	  lines for the "error_log" of CUPS which have more than 1024
	  characters, as this makes CUPS aborting the job.
	
	  Fixed PPR spooler auto-detection. Now foomatic-rip should
	  work as a PPR interface as ppromatic.

	  Additional comments about non-PostScript and documentation
	  printing and also about the kid processes of foomatic-rip
	  and what they do.

	  Minor clean-ups.
	
2002-11-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Now it should be possible not only to use the
	  new (Perl-free, version 2.9.x) Foomatic PPD files with
	  foomatic-rip, but also manufacturer-supplied PPD files of
	  PostScript printers. This way one can use these PPD files with
	  every spooler and also spooler-less.

	  The settings of "PageSize" and "PageRegion" are kept in sync
	  now, so on does not need to take care whether "PageSize" or
	  "PageRegion" is used to set the paper size.

	  The "*JCL..." keywords in PostScript files of PostScript
	  printers are recognized, so the JCL options of the files are
	  taken into account and the user can adjust them.

	  Remove "dossy" ("\r\n") line ends from the lines read from the
	  PPD file, so also PPD files downloaded under Windows should be
	  correctly parsed.

	  Bugfix: Allow trailing whitespace in "*OrderDependency" lines of
	  the PPD file, for all other keywords trailing whitespace was
	  already allowed.

	  Added more comments about the PostScript parsing, especially
	  about stuffing in PostScript code from command line options
	  and default settings.

	  Workaround for "dvips" bug that it misses inserting a
	  "%%BeginProlog" comment. This will now be handled correctly.

	  Make sure that code for default and command line option settings
	  get also inserted in the job when it has the DSC magic string
	  ("%!PS-Adobe-..") but is not DSC-conforming in reality.
	
	  To be more general, use the expression "JCL" (Job Control
	  Language) instead of "PJL" (Print Job Language) for variable
	  names and comments.

	  Some minor clean-ups.

2002-11-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: Now it should be possible to print with all
	  spoolers, but only PostScript, no plain text or help pages.

	  Added code to parse the command line options,
	  now one can control jobs also by command line options and not
	  only by stuffing settings into the PostScript file.

	  Insert code of PostScript options into the appropriate sections
	  of the PostScript job. This is not done for CUPS as there the
	  "pstops" filter does it already.

	  Correct option settings for numerical options which the "pstops"
	  already inserts. "pstops" inserts the default setting when the
	  user-supplied value is not one of the choices in the PPD file.
	  Now foomatic-rip replaces the default value by the correct value
	  from the command line (or from "/.lpoptions).

	  Inserted page accounting code for CUPS.

	  If an enumerated choice option has only one choice, set this one
	  as the default choice. There was no default set before.

	  Support for postpipes (command line into which to stuff the
	  output of the renderer).

2002-11-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: foomatic-rip is one filter to be used with
	  all spoolers now (Currently CUPS works without accounting
	  and spooler-less printing only to stdout and without
	  inserting of command line options).

	  Completed spooler auto-detection and loading of queue and
	  job information needed for executing the job.

	  Introduced loop to print more than one file per job (needed
	  for spooler-less printing).

	  Parse definition of a postpipe (command into which output of
	  renderer will be piped) in the PPD file, using the syntax
	  '*FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "..."'. Use of the postpipe needs still
	  to be implemented. The postpipe is needed for LPD/LPRng/GNUlpr
	  and spooler-less printing.
	
2002-11-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: foomatic-rip works also as a CUPS filter,
	  without any modifications and without wrapper. Accounting
	  and help page is not supported yet. It is planned to also use
	  it as filter for the other spoolers without wrapper (spooler
	  auto-detection).

	  Made foomatic-rip also recognizing option
	  settings embedded in PostScript files with "dossy" line ends
	  ("\r\n").

	  Made it more tolerant against not exactly DSC-conforming
	  PostScript. as for example CUPS' "pstops" does not put page-
	  specific option settings between "%%BeginPageSetup" and
	  "%%EndPageSetup".

	  Handle the problem that there can be a "%%PS-Adobe" header, but
	  the document is not DSC-conforming. Stop parsing when the next
	  DSC section is not found after a certain amount of lines.

	  Parse also "%%BeginProlog", "%%EndProlog", "%%BeginSetup",
	  "%%EndSetup", "%%BeginFeature", and "%%EndFeature" comments so
	  that additional option settings can be inserted.
	
2002-11-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/*omatic.pl.in: Made filters also recognizing option settings
	  embedded in PostScript files with "dossy" line ends ("\r\n").
	
2002-11-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-rip.in: "foomatic-rip", the filter to translate
	  PostScript input to the printer's native language using printer
	  capability info from a new Perl-free PPD file. It expects the
	  name of the PPD file in the environment variable PPD or with the
	  "-p" command line option and the PostScript on standard input,
	  the job translated to the printer's native language appears as
	  standard output.
	  
	  The filter recognizes DSC-conforming PostScript documents and
	  searches for inserted options settings at all allowed places
	  without loading the whole document into memory. It handles also
	  command line and PJL arguments given onely for certain pages, in
	  this case the renderer (usually GhostScript) is restarted with a
	  new command line and/or new prepended PJL. For
	  non-DSC-conforming documents only settings in the beginning of
	  the file are recognized.

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Taken into account the new
	  "foomatic-rip" filter.
	
2002-10-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/*omatic.pl.in: Support for custom page sizes. A choice named
	  "Custom" in the "PageSize" option is considered as custom page
	  size. Its "<ev_driverval>" should contain a placeholder "%0" for
	  the page width and "%1" for the page height (both in points).
	  Alternatively the "<ev_driverval>" can contain two zeros ("0")
	  from which the first will be replaced by the page width and the
	  second by the page height. PPD files will get Adobe-complient
	  for the custom page size support. So CUPS and the printing
	  dialog of Mac OS X should have no problems with the custom paper
	  size. Now custom paper sizes are available for all spoolers:

	  CUPS: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  LPRng: lpr -P huge -Z PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  GNUlpr: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  LPD: lpr -P huge -JPageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  PPR: ppr -P huge -F "*PageSize Custom" -i 500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  PDQ: pdq -P huge -oPageSize_Custom -aPageWidth=500
	           -aPageHeight=750 -oPageSizeUnit_cm bigposter.ps
	  No spooler: directomatic -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm
	           bigposter.ps

2002-10-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Splitted Foomatic into four packages:
	
	  - foomatic-filters: Filter scripts used by the spoolers to
	    convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's
	    native format using a printer/driver specific PPD file
	  - foomatic-db-engine: Foomatic's database engine generates
	    PPD files from the data in Foomatic's XML database. It also
	    contains scripts to directly generate print queues and handle
	    jobs.
	  - foomatic-db: The collected knowledge about printers, drivers,
	    and driver options in XML files, used by foomatic-db-engine
	    to generate PPD files.
	  - foomatic-db-hpijs: Foomatic XML data generator for HP's HPIJS
	    driver.
	
	  This package is foomatic-filters.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Removed all portions not needed for
	  foomatic-filters.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, makeMan.in, lpdomatic.8.in,
	  directomatic.1.in: Made insertion of paths in man pages working
	  without Defaults.pm.

	* configure.in: Fixed check to set /etc instead of /usr/local/etc
	  as $sysconfdir.
	
	* mfomatic.in: This file was not maintained for long time and
	  noone asked for it, removed.

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-generator: Mentioned that the
	  current Foomatic data is also for HPIJS 1.2.2.

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap, db/source/printer/*:
	  Added the HP DeskJet 450, 3320, 6122, 6127, PhotoSmart P230, PSC
	  2150.

	* data-generators/hpijs*/hpijs*-generator: Corrected "Best
	  Grayscale" modes for the HP DeskJet 350, 6xxC series, and the
	  Apollo printers, the mode supports only 600x300 (not 300x300)
	  dpi and all except the DeskJet 350 and the 63xC series use
	  both and not only the black cartridge.

	* db/source/printer/*: Changed recommended driver to "hpijs-rss"
	  when it was "hpijs" before (the patched version has better
	  output quality).

	* db/source/printer/*: Raised ratings of all "DJ9xx"-class HP
	  inkjets without fax facility from "Mostly" to
	  "Perfectly". Updated the texts of all "DJ9xx"-class models
	  (because of the patched HPIJS, "hpijs-rss").
	
	* db/source/printer/*: Raised ratings of the HP PPA printers
	  (supported by the "pnm2ppa" driver from "Mostly" to "Perfectly",
	  the driver supports their full functionality.
	
	* db/source/driver/PostScript.xml: Added link to Kurt Pfeifle's
	  tutorial chapter about PostScript to the text of the
	  "Postscript" driver entry.

2002-09-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in: Made command line option list only be
	  logged in debug mode. Mac OS X adds very many options to the
	  CUPS filter chain and so the option list gets longer than 1024
	  bytes and this CUPS cannot handle in its error_log file.
	
2002-09-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

2002-09-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-generator: The 300-dpi normal mode
	  for the "LJMono" device class uses 600 dpi internally and so
	  does not work on the 300-dpi-only printers as the HP LaserJet 4L.
	  Restricted these printers to use the 300-dpi draft mode which
	  does real 300 dpi.
	
2002-08-31  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in, src/directomatic.pl.in, src/lpdomatic.pl.in:
	  Now option settings stuffed into the PPD files have priority
	  against settings done via command line options given with the
	  printing command. This is done to make sure that settings given
	  in applications (also on clients with other spooler/OS) have are
	  taken into account.

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in: Numerical options give on the command line
	  and not being exactly of a value given as choice in the
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD file are now overriding the PPD defaults which
	  "pstops" inserts into the PostScript, but they are overridden
	  when an application stuffs settings into the PostScript file.

	  (i7tiol at t-online dot de).

	* db/source/printer/*: Added auto-detection info to the HP LaserJet
	  2100. Due to the 2100 and 2100M having the same auto-detection

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: Updated driver priority list to
	  give higher priority to the old HP LaserJet/PCL drivers coming
	  with GhostScript than to Gimp-Print. The old drivers work better
	  on laser printers.

	* db/source/printer/*: Use the old GhostScript driers ("ljet4",

	* db/source/*/*: Corrected "hpijs" entry for the HP 2500C/2500CN,
	  they belong to the "DJ9xxVIP" group (as the HP DeskJet 990C), so
	  they work perfectly with "hpijs". Replaced model string "HP
	  BUSINESS INKJET 2250" by "DESKJET 990", the former string is
	  not recognized by "hpijs" (in contrary to the driver's
	  documentation).

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Sony IJP-V100 multi-function device.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added '*PSVersion: "(3010.000) 653"' entry

	  function let the ISO B sizes be returned, when the paper size
	  name is only "Bx" without "JIS" or "ISO". This is also the
	  default of GhostScript.
	
	* Makefile.in: Fixed bug of database going to
	  /usr/local/share/share/foomatic.

	* foomatic-configure.in: Made "foomatic-configure -Q -q -r"

	* Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in, configure.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Eliminated dependency on the "libwww-perl" Perl library, used
	  command line tools "wget" or "curl" instead. Now Foomatic should
	  work only with standard Perl libraries as being part of Perl
	  itself.

	* USAGE, README: Added the requirement of one of the tools "wget"
	  and "curl".

	* db/source/driver/gdi.xml: Updates URLs.

	  src/lpdomatic.pl.in, src/lpdomatic.pl, src/ppromatic.pl.in,
	  src/ppromatic.pl: Introduced a GNU-autoconf-generated "configure"
	  script, now one can easily install Foomatic with the well-known
	  "./configure; make; make install".
	
2002-04-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-ppdload: Switched foomatic-ppdload to the new
	  Perl-XML/Grove-free DB.pm.

	* foomatic-ppdload, foomatic-ppdload.8.in: Added "-R" option to
	  remove a printer from the "ppd" driver.

	* README: Removed paragraph that foomatic-ppdload needs the old
	  Perl-XML/Grove DB.pm.

	* lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: Let the "PageRegion" option in the PPD file
	  being skipped when creating Foomatic XML data. It is te same
	  option as "PageSize".
	
	* db/source/driver/Postscript.xml: Corrected HTML tags.
	
2002-04-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added reading of auto-detection data also
	  for the USB and SNMP connection types. Added support for returning
	  commants and texts in other languages the english ("-l <language>"
	  command line option).

	* db/source/printer/HP-PSC_750.xml: Added USB auto-detection info.

2002-04-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made the "sortargs()" and "sortvals()"
	  functions working with Perl 5.0x. The "sort()" function of these
	  old Perl versions only supports the two items to compare being
	  given to the copmaring function via the global variables "$a"
	  and "$b", and not via "@_". linuxprinting.org runs Perl 5.005.
	  Made also the choices for the options better sorted, especially
	  Letter/A4 paper sizes in the beginning of the list, resolutions
	  and "Upper"/"Middle"/"Lower" trays correctly sorted, "Default"
	  in the beginning of the lists.

2002-04-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>
	
	* foomatic-perl-data.c: New C program to parse the XML code to
	  generate Perl data structures from it. Uses libxml (libxml 2.x
	  recommended because otherwise XML files beginning with a blank
	  line cannot be read).
	
	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed disk cache and XML/Grove Perl
	  library usage completely, all XML handling is done by C code
	  now. Added paper sizes of the Dymo-CoStar/Avery label printers
	  to the "getpapersize()" function, now the "ImageableArea" and
	  "PaperDimension" entries in the PPD files are built correctly
	  for these printers. Added possibility to output a combo XML file
	  with the option default settings set to the values of the queue
	  currently worked on.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB_perl_xml.pm: Stored old XML/Grove/disk cache
	  version of the Foomatic database library. Added documentation
	  for this file as comments in its beginning.

	* foomatic-configure, foomatic-printjob: Removed "grove-pathval"
	  expression from "use Foomatic::DB.pm" line.

	* foomatic-configure: When a printer queue is set up or modified,
	  the option default settings are also set in the
	  /etc/foomatic/<queue>.xml.gz printer/driver combo XML file. So
	  frontends can also read the option settings from the XML file.

	* foomatic-ppdload: Re-linked to old lib/Foomatic/DB_perl_xml.pm,
	  Perl-XML/Grove-free version not implemented yet.

	* foomatic-compiledb, foomatic-compiledb.8.in,
	  foomatic-compiledb.1.in: In the cache-less time this has a new
	  purpose: It generates data files for a chosen spooler (or combo
	  XML files) and for either selected or all drivers. Moved man
	  page to section 1, foomatic-compiledb works from a normal user
	  account now (due to the removed cache).

	* foomatic-datafile.8.in, foomatic-datafile.1.in: Moved man
	  page to section 1, foomatic-datafile works from a normal user
	  account now (due to the removed cache).

	* foomatic-fix-xml: Remove leading blank lines from the XML files
	  in the local Foomatic database. The leading blank lines make the
	  XML files not readable by libxml 1.x.

	* Makefile: Added compilation and installation of
	  foomatic-perl-data.c.

	* Makefile, makeDefault: Commented out all cache-related stuff.
	
	* Makefile: Moved foomatic-datafile and foomatic-compiledb from
	  /usr/sbin to /usr/bin.

	* README, USAGE: Foomatic version 1.9 (Foomatic without
	  Perl-XML/Grove and without disk cache).

	* db/source/*/*: Replaced all occurences of a cross character
	  (used in resolutions as "600x300 dpi") by an "x" (the letter
	  "X").  libxml chokes on the cross. Removed leading blank lines
	  from the XML files, because this breaks libxml 1.x.

2002-04-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added new paper sizes of Gimp-Print to the
	  paper size table of the "getpapersize" function, fixed a bug of
	  wrong calculation of "wXXXhYYY" and "XXXxYYY" paper sizes in the
	  same function.

2002-03-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/ppromatic.pl: Made ppromatic also working in non-english
	  configurations.

	* db/source/driver/stp.xml: Added warning that this file is only
	  for Gimp-Print 4.0.x.

2002-03-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Added possibility to modify the default
	  option settings in the generated XML ("-o" command line option

	* db/source/printer/HP-LaserJet_12?0.xml: LaserJet 1200/1220 is 
	  very slow in graphics, added user report.
	
2002-03-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of all HP printers and
	  multi-function devices which need HPOJ or the modified printer.c
	  kernel module to be able to print via USB.

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of the HP PhotoSmart 1[012]xx
	  printers because they need the modified USB printer.c kernel
	  module from the HPOJ website to work together with HPOJ.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Okidata OL400e, HP OfficeJet D125, and
	  HP LaserJet 3310 MFP and updated the driver data appropriately.

	* db/source/*/*: Removed spaces from the names of the Okidata
	  OLxxx models, so that they get correctly sorted in the printer
	  listings. Modified option entries appropriately.
	
2002-03-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of many HP and Apollo printers
	  and moved many of them from "Mostly" to "Perfectly".

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of HP OfficeJet G and K series
	  because they need HPOJ also when one only wants to print via
	  USB.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Apollo P-1220 Barbie, P1250, P2250,
	  P-2550, and P-2650. Updated the driver data appropriately.
	
2002-03-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated data for the "hpijs" driver to fit
	  to HPIJS 1.0.4. Modified printer entries appropriate to the new
	  features ("hpijs" also recommended on large format printers,
	  DeskJet 990 and compatibles work "Perfectly").
	
2002-03-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Modified text of HP LaserJet 1200, USB
	  printing only works with HPOJ.
	
2002-03-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Introduced two debug output levels ("-v",
	  "-vv"). Now I do not need a special debug version any more.

2002-03-17  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* makeDefaults: Added flag $DEBUG to enable debug messages from
	  Perl modules. It is not exported by default, you can import it
	  by adding qw(:DEFAULT $DEBUG) to the "use Foomatic::Defaults"
	  clause.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Cache is disabled if CACHEDIR is set to an
	  empty string at compile time, ie. "make CACHEDIR=".

2002-03-17  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* debian/*: Docs README, TODO, USAGE were not included in the
	  debian package.
	  Changed handling of local changes by the debconf interface.

2002-03-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Modified text of HP LaserJet 31x0
	  multi-function devices, because of the available code pieces for
	  a free software driver for these models.
	
2002-03-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Corrected entries for Brother printers
	  driven by the "hl7x0" driver.
	
2002-03-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Fixed default "Quality" setting for the photo-
	  capable HP DeskJet 6xxC printers with the "hpijs" driver.

	* db/source/*/*: Fixed Foomatic data for the B4 and B5 paper sizes
	  of the "hpijs" driver.
	* db/source/*/*: "Photo Full Bleed" paper size is only supported by
	  the PhotoSmart P100 for the "hpijs" driver, fixed Foomatic data.
	
2002-03-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Canon BJC-255SP and BJC-265SP. Modified
	  "bjx250gs" driver entry appropriately.

2002-03-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: When "foomatic-configure" creates a queue
	  for LPRng, the permissions for the /var/log/lp-errs file are set
	  correctly now.
	
2002-03-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added Lexmark E210 laser printer (Samsung ML-4500
	  clone, "gdi" driver).

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug that of float options in
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD files only the integer part of the default value
	  was read.

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Fixed Red Hat bug #58319
	  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58319).
	  Some PostScript files cannot be handled by "gs ... - < file",
	  but they need "gs ... /dev/fd/0 < file".

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed quoting for PDQ, now more complicated
	  driver command lines with quotes and shell script variables also
	  work with the PDQ-O-Matic config file generator. Assured that for
	  every call of GhostScript "foomatic-gswrapper" is used, to fix
	  Red Hat bug #58319 for all drivers, especially "Postscript".

	* src/*omatic.pl: Assured that for every call of GhostScript
	  "foomatic-gswrapper" is used, to fix Red Hat bug #58319 for all
	  drivers, especially "Postscript".

	  a PJL options is there. Many printers are listed as PJL-capable
	  in the database, but in reality they are not.

2002-03-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl, src/ppromatic.pl: Fixed reading default option
	  choices with a "+" from the PPD file.

2002-02-06  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Cache files created by "foomatic-combo-xml"
	  were not read sometimes, fixed.

2002-02-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Added "remove_trash" target to remove temporary and
	  backup files created by editors and the patch utility. In
	  "testing_clean" target added "-f" to the "rm" command for the
	  links to the cache so that make does not stop with an error when
	  the links are not there.

2002-02-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, src/*omatic, filter.conf: Modified Foomatic to only
	  make the filter scripts out of the source files in src/. Fixed
	  bugs on filter script source files: "enscript -b <title>", not
	  "enscript -b=<title>"; empty title gave a line on the top of the
	  page when using "mpage". Added "-J" (job title) option to
	  directomatic. Added sample filter.conf.

	* cupsomatic, ppromatic, lpdomatic, directomatic: Removed obsolete
	  filter scripts.

	* directomatic.1.in: Added "-J" (job title) option.

2002-02-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  Overwrite PATH in INPLACE version too.  Changed revision to 2.1
	  to avoid $lomversion clashes with the old scripts.

	* src/cupsomatic.pl, src/directomatic.pl, src/ppromatic.pl:
	  Bootstrapped from corresponding filter scripts.

	* src/Makefile: cupsomatic, directomatic and ppromatic get also
	  built.

2002-02-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults, foomatic-configure, USAGE, README: Added
	  support for HPOJ (http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/, low-level driver
	  for HP's multi-function devices) with "ptal:/..." URIs.

	* lpdomatic: Corrected the path to the configuration file.

2002-01-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-kitload, foomatic-kitload.8.in: Added "-d" option to
	  install the kit into a staging area from which a package will
	  be built (as "DESTDIR=..." in GNU automake/autoconf). This is
	  a patch from Roger Leigh.

	* makeDefaults: Added the possibility to set the cache directory
	  alternatively with FOOMATIC_CACHEDIR instead of CACHEDIR.

	* cupsomatic, ppromatic, lpdomatic, directomatic: Modified parser
	  for options embedded in the job data so that option and value
	  names can contain all printable characters except white space
	  and "=". This fixed a problem with the "Color Mode" option of
	  the "pcl3" driver.
	
2002-01-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added the HP LaserJet 3P with PCL5 extension.
	
2002-01-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* USAGE: Minor text modifications for XPP 1.1.

	* db/source/*/*: Renamed the database entry for the Canon LIPS-II+
	  from "Canon-LIPS-II+" to "Canon-LIPS-IIplus". With the "+" in its
	  ID the printer entry was not accessible on the linuxprinting.org
	  web site.
	
2002-01-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Replaced "-sOutputFile=|cat>&3" by

	* src/lpdomatic.pl: PJL patch from Tim Waugh. Can select one of
	  the builtin enscriptcommands by setting textfilter to "a2ps",
	  "mpage" or "enscript" (without arguments).
	* debian/rules: Cleanup database.

2002-01-23  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* src: Introduced the subdirectory.
	* Makefile: Include a target to make the filter scripts from src/.
	* src/lpdomatic.pl: New source file from which lpdomatic can be
	  generated.

2002-01-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/160.xml: Added Epson EPL lasers to constraint in
	  "Mode" option of "pxlmono"/"pxlcolor", they print only in bw.

	* db/source/printer/*: The Epson EPL-5900/5900PS works perfectly
	  with "pxlmono", updated text, rating, and recommended driver.

	* db/source/printer/*: Raised the rating for the Lexmark Z42 and
	  Compaq IJ1200 to "Mostly", to reflect the experience of the
	  author of "drv_z42" with these printers.

	* db/source/printer/*: Corrected the ratings/texts for the Epson
	  Stylus Pro 7000/7500/9000/9500/10000.

	* lpdomatic/makeDefaults: Modified the config file support to not
	  need a Perl library to make it easier to install lpdomatic without
	  installing the whole Foomatic package.	

2002-01-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added '*PSVersion: "(3010.000) 652"' entry
	  for GhostScript 6.52 to the PPD files.
	
2002-01-20  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* lpdomatic: Corrected the use of ConfigFile.pm.
	* makeDefaults: Write "1;" at the end of ConfigFile.pm.
	* foomatic-configure: Added $J to lprng filter options, (prints
	  job title with a2ps).
	* makeDefaults: Added code to write lib/Foomatic/ConfigFile.pm.
	* lpdomatic: Adds --center-title=$optJ to a2ps command line.
	  Enscriptcommand and debug flag can be specified in a config file
	  in $ETCDIR/filter.conf. Syntax is tag\s*:\s*value.
	  Added tabulator/indentation settings for emacs.

2002-01-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/Epson-AcuLaser_C1000.xml: Added the Epson
	  AcuLaser C1000 (Paperweight).

	* db/source/*/*: Applied a patch by Tim Waugh (twaugh at redhat
	  dot com) which makes the Perl one-liners for paper tray
	  selection on PCL laser printers working on both Perl 5.6.0 and
	  5.6.1.  The one-liners are in the GhostScript command lines of
	  the drivers entries for the PCL laser drivers ("lj5gray",
	  "ljet4", ...).

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of the Epson EPL-5900/5900PS
	  because of a bug in Epson's driver.
	
2002-01-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  for Epson-Kowa laser driver 1.0.4.
	
2002-01-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic, ppromatic, directomatic: Auto-detection
	  of file converters a2ps, enscript, mpage, usage of the printer's
	  paper size setting for conversion to PostScript, with a2ps the
	  possibility to print also PDF, images, etc with LPD/LPRng and
	  with directomatic (CUPS and PPR do this by themselves, they use
	  the converter only for the docs pages).

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of "-Q" with PPR not working for
	  non-root users. CUPS queues are automatically set up with
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD files now (use "--oldppd" to get CUPS-O-Matic
	  PPD files), for PPD the PPD file is not stored twice any more, a
	  symbolic link is set instead.

	* README, ChangeLog, foomatic-configure.1.in: Updated documentation
	  to take into account the new "--oldppd" option.
	
	* db/source/*/*: HP removed the "HP only" clause from the license
	  of HPIJS, so HPIJS is free now.
	
2002-01-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed some incompatibilities in the PDQ file
	  generator which prevented HPIJS 1.0 from working with PDQ.
	
2002-01-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of foomatic-configure stopping on
	  directomatic printer configuration when there is no directomatic
	  config file.
	
2002-01-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic/ppromatic: The PPD default values of float options were
	  not read correctly, fixed.

2002-01-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added HP e-printer e20 to HPIJS 1.0 datafiles.

	* db/source/printers/*: Removed "Unverified" flags and cleaned up
	  text in many datafiles of HP inkjet printers.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Only set new default driver when the
	  current one is not OK.

	* foomatic-configure: Insert ":ppdfile=<PPD file name>:\" lines
	  into /etc/printcap (for LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng), so that the graphical
	  printing frontend GPR finds the PPD-O-Matic PPD files
	  automatically.
	
2002-01-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added "bjc250gs" driver and Canon BJC-250ex
	  printer.

2002-01-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Replaced "-sOutputFile=|cat >&3" by
	  "-sOutputFile=|cat>&3" because the second one also works when
	  "gs" is a wrapper script around the real GhostScript binary.
	
2002-01-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Numerical options given on the command line were
	  ignored when using a PPD-O-Matic PPD file for the CUPS queue.
	  Fixed.
	
2002-01-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults, lpdomatic.8.in: Moved lpdomatic back to
	  /usr/sbin.
	
2002-01-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added support for direct, spooler-less
	  printing with directomatic, added auto-detection of PPR.

	* directomatic: Added support for having a default printer.

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "lprng" as possible datafile type (gives
	  the same result as "lpd").

	* foomatic-configure.1.in: Completed the list of possible options,
	  corrected "-D" options ("Default", not "Delete").

	* foomatic-printjob.1.in: Corrected command line for printing.

	* README, USAGE: Updated to take into account all recent changes.
	
2002-01-06  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* foomatic-configure: Bails out if it encounters a lprng style
	  printcap, like those created by lprngtool, as it would hose it
	  otherwise.  This needs a better solution.
	* foomatic-configure.1.in: Added description of the above problem.
	* debian/control: The conflict with the cupsomatic-ppd package is
	  indicated.

2002-01-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added definitions for PPR and for
	  spooler-less printing.

	* db/source/driver/Postscript.xml: Updated the text to also
	  mention that PPD files can be used also with the PPR spooler or
	  the GPR printing frontend.

2002-01-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Made ppromatic stuffing the PostScript code of all
	  PostScript options into the job, in contrary to CUPS PPR only
	  stuffs in the code of options explicitly given on the command
	  line or in the "Switchset".

	* foomatic-configure: Added PPR support.
	
2002-01-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Made it possible to have PPD files in other
	  directories than /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles, let ppromatic eat up
	  data on STDIN to make documentation printing ("-i docs") working
	  correctly. When original job is not completely read, PPR does
	  not dequeue the print job and stops the printer because it
	  assumes that the job was not correctly printed.

2002-01-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added Compaq IJ1200 (Z42 clone), assigned Lexmark
	  5700 drivers to Compaq IJ900 (5700 clone). Fixed text of Lexmark
	  5700.

	* db/source/opt/hpijs-Quality.xml: Fixed typo in human-readable
	  text for 600-dpi-CMYK-normal quality.
	
2002-01-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/hpijs-PageSize.xml: Worked around a bug in HPIJS
	  1.0 which breaks the paper size setting via PostScript commands.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added photo paper sizes for the HPIJS 1.0
	  driver to the "getpapersize()" function.

2002-01-01  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	  driver.
	
2001-12-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Applied a patch from Crutcher Dunnavant
	  (crutcher@redhat.com) which sets all Perl variables in shell
	  command lines ($poid, $drv. $libdir, ...) into single quotes, so
	  that nothing breaks when a strange printer/driver ID or a
	  strangely named directory is used.

	* db/source/driver/*: Made Perl one-liner for paper tray selection
	  in PCL laser printer driver XML files less memory-consuming.

2001-12-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Made "-f" (Force compilation) flag working
	  for overview request ("-O").

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Functions using "foomatic-combo-xml" check
	  the cache before and use it, if appropriate files
	  available. Printer ID set into single quotes in the
	  "foomatic-combo-xml" command line, to not break with the new
	  clear text printer IDs (Thanks to Crutcher Dunnavant,
	  crutcher@redhat.com for his suggestions).

	* Makefile: Let "make install" also install the man pages.
	
2001-12-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* directomatic: Possibility to use a printer definition file in
	  ~/.foomatic/direct/ or in the current directory.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added /etc/ppr directory, fixed typo.

2001-12-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Set links for the new location of the
	  "Lexmark Foomatic Kit" in the comments of the database entries
	  for the Lexmark Z22, Z23, Z32, Z33, Z52, Z53.
	
2001-12-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made the "PaperDimension", "ImageableArea",
	  and "PageRegion" entries in CUPS and generic PPD files working
	  if the "PageSize" option is not the standard PostScript option,
	  but a command line option or something else (as in the
	  "ppmtocpva" or in the "pentaxpj" drivers.

	* db/source/opt/2.xml, db/source/driver/c2050.xml: Drivers
	  "c2050", "cZ11", and "cZ11somsom" had no "PageSize" option,

	* db/source/*/*: Updated home page address and comment of the
	  "lm1100" driver and added a "Brightness" option to that driver
	  and replaced the "Monochrome" option by "Ink Type".

	  linuxprinting,org, original home page is dead. Modified the
	  comments in the database entry file appropriately.
	
	* db/source/drivers/gdi.xml: Added filter for MagicFilter users to
	  easily integrate this driver. Modified the comments in the
	  database entry file appropriately.
	
	* db/source/*/*: Okipage 6w only works with "oki4w" 2.0, not with
	  2.1. Modified the comments in the database entry files
	  appropriately.

	* db/source/printers/214153.xml: My Stylus Color 500 has problems
	  with Gimp-Print 4.2. Modified the comments in the database entry
	  files appropriately.

	* db/source/opt/cZ11somsom-*: Set default values of the ink
	  densities to 50 instead of 100.

	  ultra-portable Pentax PocketJet printers.

2001-12-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Added support for the accounting facility of CUPS.
	  Only works with $debug = 0 and when GhostScript is rendering
	  the PostScript.

	* foomatic-ppdload, lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: "new PPD" and "new
	  UIElem" replaced by "new Foomatic::PPD" and "new
	  Foomatic::UIElem", otherwise the "new" methods will not be found
	  in the respective libraries.

	* db/source/printer/Lexmark-Z43.xml: Updated the comments.
	
2001-12-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* directomatic: New filter for spooler-less printing. See in the
	  comments in the beginning how to use it.

	* Makefile: Added definitions for PPR, added directomatic
	  and ppromatic to be installed

	* makeDefaults: Added definitions for PPR, moved lpdomatic to
	  /usr/bin

	* lpdomatic.1.in: lpdomatic in /usr/bin => "man 1 lpdomatic"

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "direct" data file type for 
	  Direct-O-Matic

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Modified comments of the LPD-O-Matic printer
	  description file (generated by the function "getlpddata()")
	  because these files are also used for Direct-O-Matic.
	
2001-12-07  Manfred Wassmann  <foomatic@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* Makefile: Split the install target into install-bin and
	  install-db. Added PHONY target to mark targets not related to
	  real files.
	* Manpages: Added a script to generate manpages with correct
	  pathnames from files named <manpage>.<section>.in.
	  Created more or less useable manpages for all binaries.
	* debian: Bootstrapped a debian directory for building Debian
	  packages.

2001-12-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Corrected link to documentation web page in the
	  comments in the beginning of the script.
	
2001-12-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic, ppromatic: Cleaned up multi-processing,
	  now the parent processes wait for their children to finish and
	  the interprocess communication pipes are closed after use. The
	  main process waiting for their children to exit fixes especially
	  a problem of lpdomatic: LPRng resetted the printer port when the
	  lpdomatic was ready, but in reality lpdomatic sub-processes were
	  still working on the job, which lead to incomplete pages being
	  printed (Bug #486096 on SourceForge). Also updated the comments
	  in the beginning of the files

	* foomatic-datafile: Added PPR support.

	* foomatic-configure: Added the "-w 1" option to "nc" used in the
	  $postpipe for LPD, otherwise "nc" only exits a rather long time
	  after all data has be transmitted to the printer. This prevents
	  the new lpdomatic from exiting immediately after the job has
	  finished and so it takes a longer time until the next job
	  starts.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Used "/PageSize[...]" instead of
	  "/PageRegion[...]" in the "*PageRegion" option of the
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD files becasue GhostScript does not understand
	  "/PageRegion[...]" (found this out during tests of PPR, which
	  uses the "*PageRegion" option and not the "*PageSize" option to
	  set the paper size.
	
2001-12-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Completed first version of ppromatic: Added error and
	  signal handling. Introduced back channel from child processes to
	  main process and let main process wait until all children finish,
	  to not loose any error message or exit status to report to PPR.
	
2001-11-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added some comments about the similarity of the
	  Sharp and Xerox inkjets.
	
	* db/source/opt/207.xml: Made "Model" option of "pcl3" having only
	  the correct model entry as possible choice (as "Model" option of
	  "gimp-print"/"stp".
	
2001-11-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Higher priority for "pcl3" against
	  "sharp.upp", the support of the "pcl3" driver for the Sharp and
	  Xerox inkjets is much better since version 3.3 of "pcl3".

	* db/source/*/*: Added Sharp/Xerox printers to list of printers
	  supported by "pcl3" because of better Sharp/Xerox support by
	  "pcl3" version 3.3, also changed the recommended driver of the
	  Sharp and Xerox inkjets to "pcl3" and the functionality to
	  "Mostly".
	
2001-11-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Interface for the spooler PPR (ppr.sourceforge.net)
	  introduced. To set up printer download PPD-O-Matic PPD file from
	  your driver's page of the linuxprinting.org database (or use
	  "foomatic-datafile -t ppd ...") and do

	    cp ppromatic /usr/lib/ppr/interfaces/
	    cp <downloaded ppd file> /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/
	    ppad interface <queue> ppromatic <address>
	    ppad options <queue> backend=<interface>
	    ppad ppd <queue> <ppd file without path>
	    (Addiyional command to set up paper trays)

	  <interface> means the PPR interface name for the desired printer
	  connection type (all in /usr/lib/ppr/interfaces/: parallel,
	  serial, tcpip, lpr, smb, atalk, ...).
	  <address> means the printer address as needed by the interface
	  (/dev/lp0 for parallel, printer.domain.com:9100 for tcpip, ...)
	  <ppd file without path> is the name under which you have saved
	  your downloaded PPD file. Do not specify the path 
	  /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/

2001-11-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Let numerical option default settings in be used
	  when a printer is used with a PPD-O-Matic PPD file.

2001-11-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made HTML display of how to invoke a driver
	  working correctly with the new XML Foomatic and enhanced it,
	  especially for tricky command lines ("Execution Details" pages).
	
	* db/source/opt/*: Corrected the "Required" state for many
	  options, to get the "Execution Details" pages correct.
	
2001-11-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/drv_z42: New web site for "drv_z42".

	  (<driver>..</driver>) in all non-Paperweight printer entries.

2001-11-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: The Epson Stylus C70/C80 do 2880x1440 dpi
	  under free OS. Added comment in the appropriate database
	  entries.

2001-11-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README, USAGE: Added info about the PPD-O-MATIC PPD files. 
	  Especially USAGE contains info about printing with graphical
	  interfaces and out of applications now.
	
2001-11-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Added the "sj48" driver in the list,
	  so that when one adds "omni" as the last entry, the "sj48" will
	  get priority.
	
2001-11-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Added support for GPR as CUPS printing frontend.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added generation of a generic purpose PPD
	  file (PPD-O-Matic), made generated PDQ scripts using settings
	  added by an application using the PPD file, fixed bug of PDQ not
	  printing when driver command line is composed of various shell
	  commands. Removed some replacements of special characters in the
	  generation of PDQ config files, they caused some driver command
	  lines to get "overquoted" characters.

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic: Added support for the new generic PPD
	  files, jobs are searched for settings done by applications using
	  these PPD files.

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "-t ppd" option to generate generic PPD
	  files.

	* foomatic-configure: Now for every queue a generic PPD file is

	* db/source/driver/*: Added "-Mutf8" to the "perl" calls in the
	  command line of the PCL/PCL-XL laser printer drivers with tray
	  selection, otherwise Perl 5.6.0 and older cannot handle hex
	  representations of binary strings in the Perl commands.

	* db/source/*/*: Added paper tray selection option to the PCL-XL
	  drivers ("lj5gray"/"lj5mono", "pxlmono"/"pxlcolor") and to the
	  "ljet4" driver.

2001-09-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added driver "drv_z42" for the Lexmark Z42,
	  re-rated the printer as "Partially" supported.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Assured that the "PageSize" option is always
	  present in CUPS PPD files, evwn when it has only one choice,
	  CUPS does not work when there is a PPD file without "PageSize"
	  option.

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Replaced an "strcat" by an "strcpy" when
	  setting the default value for an option because otherwise there
	  appear two values in the string for the default value.
	
	* db/source/*/*: Added GhostScript pre-filtering facility to the
	  "Postscript" driver, this allows to use additionally installed
	  GS fonts or converting to a lower PostScript level.
	
2001-09-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made all file creation be done with "umask
	  0002", so that the cache can be deleted by anyone in the group
	  of the cache creator.

	* db/source/*/*: Added Foomatic data for the Epson Stylus Color
	  640 UPP files which come with GhostScript 6.50 and newer.

2001-09-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: In the "loadfile()" function "close" was
	  used instead of "fclose". This kept all files open and lead to
	  problems with more than 1000 printer models.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Xerox DocuPrint N4512, corrected comments
	  for the HP PSC 950 and the Epson Stylus C80.
	
2001-09-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Given priority to the lxm3200 driver
	  against Gimp-Print/stp, the support of the Lexmark 3200 by
	  Gimp-Print is broken.

2001-09-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Fixed a bug of not setting the high scores
	  for the constraints.
	
2001-09-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: "checkpc -f" after any change on an LPRng
	  system. LPRng refuses to print when one file has wrong
	  permissions.
	
2001-09-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Made the "sides" (Duplex) option of CUPS working
	  with printers using Foomatic.

	* foomatic-configure: SIGHUP to LPRng daemon when setting the
	  default printer or deleting one.

2001-09-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added the Lexmark Z23, Z33, and Z53

	* db/source/printer/486066.xml: The Lexmark Z12 does not print
 	  ain text

	  Lexmark Z52 works "Perfectly".

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated and corrected text of the Lexmark
	  Z23, Z33, and Z52.

	* db/source/printer/62720.xml, db/source/driver/lj5*: The HP
	  LaserJet 5L does not work with the lj5gray/lj5mono drivers.

	* cupsomatic: All enumerated options with choices "On", "Off",
	  "Yes", "No", "True", or "False" did not work with CUPS. This is
	  fixed now.
	
2001-09-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Possibility to set a system-wide default
	  printer for all spoolers, for CUPS and PDQ, non-root users can
	  also set a personal default printer. Due to the architecture of
	  LPD a queue named "lp" will be renamed when another queue is set
	  as the default queue.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added the "lpoptions" utility of CUPS
	  which is needed to set a remote printer as default or to set
	  a personal default printer for non-root users.

	* USAGE: Added information about the new default printer setting
	  facility.

	* README: Adapted to all recent changes.

	* TODO: Removed the topic about speed and memory consumption, this
	  is solved by foomatic-combo-xml.c now.
	
2001-09-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Added functionality for generating the
	  overview XML file ("-O" option). Makes the overview XML
	  generation much faster, less than a second on most machines.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let the overview XML generation be done
	  preferrably by foomatic-combo-xml.c.

	* Makefile: Added the removal of the foomatic-combo-xml binary
	  to the "clean" section, let foomatic-preferred-driver be
	  installed in /usr/sbin.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Bugfix: Often default driver entries
	  were not inserted into the printer XML file.
	
	* db/source/driver/ppmtocpva.xml: Added the Alps MD-1500 printer.
	
2001-08-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Several fixes on the comments of the HP
	  OfficeJets.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Apple LaserWriter 4/600.

	* db/source/printer/605074.xml, db/source/printer/609714.xml:
	  Correction: The HP LaserJet 5Si and 3200se support PJL.

	* db/source/driver/lj5gray.xml: Removed duplicate entry for the
	  HP LaserJet 5Si.
	
2001-08-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: C program to build XML files for
	  printer/driver combos, around 600 times faster than the perl
	  routines in lib/Foomatic/DB.pm (one Gimp-Print combo in 0.5-1.5
	  sec. foomatic-compiledb in a few minutes), needs less than 10 MB
	  of memory. Pre-building of the database for distros not needed
	  any more.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Make foomatic-combo-xml.c being preferrably
	  used for building printer/driver combo data.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Integration of foomatic-combo-xml.c.
	
2001-08-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/driver/*: Removed printer entry 207945 from the printer
	  list of the "laserjet" and "stp" drivers, the printer was deleted.
	
2001-08-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/HP-DesignJet_750.xml: added HP DesignJet 750,
	  it is supported by Gimp-Print now.
	
2001-08-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added a whole bunch of japanese printers and
	  drivers, thanks to Crutcher Dunnavant from Red Hat.

	* db/source/driver/md2k.xml: Added the Alps MD-1500.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Priorities for the japanese drivers.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Epson laser printer drivers.

	* db/source/printer/641170.xml: Removed duplicate entry for the
	  Canon LBP-800.

2001-08-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added new Brother printers: HL-1440, H:-1450,
	  HL-1470N, HL-2460, HL-2460N, HL-2400CeN, HL-3400CN, MFC-P2500.

	* db/source/*/*: Added some more Brothers to the hl1250 driver.

	* db/source/opt/207.xml, db/source/opt/208.xml: Corrected default
	  settings for the Apollo P-1200 with the pcl3 driver. It needs
	  the the model setting "Unspecified old model" and a CMY colour
	  mode.

	* db/source/driver/hpijs.xml, db/source/opt/hpijs-Model.xml,
	  db/source/opt/hpijs-Quality.xml, db/source/printer/413737.xml:
	  The Apollo P-2200 works with drivers for the HP DeskJet 612C,
	  taken this into account.

	* db/source/printer/Okidata-ML_32?.xml, db/source/driver/okiibm.xml:
	  Added the printers Okidata ML 320/321.

	* db/source/printer/63200.xml: Added comment to the IBM 4019.

	* db/source/printer/317321.xml, db/source/printer/607474.xml:

	  special software.

	* db/source/printer/24832.xml: Added useful info about the NEC P6
	  plus.

	* db/source/driver/epsonc.xml: This driver is needed to print on
	  the NEC PinWriter P6/P6 plus in colour.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Given priority to the "necp6" driver
	  against the "epsonc" because in most cases the NEC PinWriter P6
	  is used without colour add-on.

	* db/source/*/*: Fixed bug in hpijs driver data: The docs talk about
	  "DJ6xxP" for the "DeviceName" setting for photo-capable DeskJet
	  6xx models, in reality "DJ6xxPhoto" has to be used.

	* db/source/driver/sharp.upp.xml: Explained how to install
	  "sharp.upp".

2001-08-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/337577.xml: Duplicate entry for the HP OfficeJet
	  G55, deleted.

	* db/source/printer/Sharp*: Added the printers Sharp AJ-1805,
	  AJ-2005, and AJ-2100.

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated the entries for the Xerox DocuPrint
	  M750 and M760, they print with "sharp.upp" and are both partially
	  working.

	* db/source/driver/sharp.upp.xml: Added the new Sharp printers 
	  (AJ-1805/2005) and the Xerox DucuPrint M750/M760.

	* db/source/driver/hl1250.xml: Updated the URL of the driver's home
	  page.

	* db/source/driver/hl1250.xml, db/source/opt/53.xml: Removed the
	  "Model" option from the "hl1250" driver, the GhostScript option
	  "-sDEVICE=hl1240" or "-sDEVICE=hl1250" only determines the
	  default resolution which is anyway overridden by Foomatic.

	* db/source/opt/161.xml: The media source selection for the
	  "Postscript" driver only works for HP printers, restricted to HP.
	
2001-08-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added HP and Apollo printers: Apollo P-2100,
	  P-2150, HP DeskJet 816C, 980C, e-printer e20, PhotoSmart P1215,
	  P1218, OfficeJet K60, K80, V40, PSC 300, 750.

	* db/source/*/hpijs*: Updated the data for the inkjet driver of HP
	  ("hpijs").

	* db/source/*/DJ*: Deleted the old data of the HP driver (drivers
	  "DJxxx").

	* db/source/*/*: Updated all information about the multifunction
	  devices of HP, they are all capable for scanning with free 
	  software.

	* db/source/printer/641138.xml: Duplicate entry for the Canon
	  LBP-800, deleted.

2001-08-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Moved foomatic-configure from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin.
	
	* db/source/printer/Epson-Stylus_C[24]0*: Split up the entries for
	  the Epson Stylus C20/C40 into the SX and UX models. This is needed
	  for the Gimp-Print GhostScript driver.

2001-08-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for printers on NetWare (with LPD
	  and LPRng), output of the printer list both as root and normal
	  user, LPRng SIGHUP after adding a new queue, spooler detection
	  bug fix.
	
2001-08-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of options not being conserved
	  when changing parameters of a CUPS or PDQ printer. $olddatablob
	  was defined at the wrong place. Added paths for rlpr, nc, and
	  smbclient to Defaults.pm, so these commands can also be called
	  when foomatic-configure is running in an environment without
	  $PATH, for example during the installation of a distro.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Paths for rlpr, nc, and smbclient added.
	
2001-08-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/ppmtocpva-solidblack.xml: Added option "-solidblack"
	  to "ppmtocpva" driver, it is new in the version 1.0 of the driver.

	* db/source/printer/168201.xml: Corrected the resolution of the
	  Citizen Printiva 600C.

	* db/source/driver/ppmtocpva.xml: Added the old Alps MD models to
	  the printers supported by the "ppmtocpva" driver.

2001-08-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-cleanupdrivers: Removes all driver entries without
	  command line (<prototype>..</prototype>) from a local Foomatic
	  database. So frontends do not display "unusable" printer/driver
	  combos.

	* foomatic-preferred-drivers: Simple program which adds a
	  <driver>..</driver> entry to every printer. The best driver is
	  determined by a ranking. When one deletes all XML files for
	  drivers which are not available on the system (and adds XML files
	  for additional drivers) all printers will have the best driver
	  of the current system as preferred driver.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Exported "get_overview" for
	  foomatic-preferred-drivers.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the newest inkjets of Epson and the newest
	  lasers of HP: Epson Stylus C20, C40, Epson Stylus Photo 785,
	  875, 895, Epson Stylus Pro 10000, HP LaserJet 1200, 1220, 2200,
	  3200m, 4100, 8150, 9000, HP Color LaserJet 4550.

	* db/source/*/*: Corrected driver list for the HP LaserJet 3200se,
	  it is the same as for the HP LaserJet 3200 now.

	* db/source/driver/bjc600.xml: Removed the Canon BJC-5000 from the
	  list of supported printers, it is a paperweight for sure.

	* db/source/printer/474354.xml: Removed this extra entry for the
	  Canon BJC-85. It was a relict of the time when the database was
	  publicly editable.

2001-07-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Take preferred driver (<driver>..</driver>
	  tag) into thw overview listing (overview.xml, foomatic-configure
	  -O).

	* db/source/opt/69.xml: Made the "Normal" quality with the "cdj880"
	  driver available again for all printers. With GNU GhostScript
	  6.51 it works without problems.
	
2001-07-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>
	
	* foomatic-configure: When one uses the -P option with a printer
	  and a driver to obtain the datablob of this combo, one can also
	  supply a queue to apply the default options of that queue to the
	  datablob of the chosen combo. This can be used when one wants to
	  change the driver used for a queue with the help of a
	  frontend. The obtained datablob can be used to generate the
	  option dialog in this situation.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: The option and choice value arrays are
	  sorted now (by a standard option list, by the "normalizename"
	  function which is already used for printer names on the web
	  site, and alphabatically/case-insensitive), so in XPDQ, KUPS,
	  QtCUPS, XPP, the upcoming new printerdrake (Mandrake 8.1), and
	  other frontends the options and choices will appear sorted.

2001-07-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added the possibility to copy/clone queues,
	  now queues can be transferred to another spooler conserving all
	  settings, including the default option settings. Restructured
	  all queue query functions, now they can also generate complete
	  Perl datablobs with all option default settings (even settings
	  which XPDQ has written into /etc/pdq/printrc or which KUPS has
	  written into the PPD files) and all queue settings as the
	  connection URI, description, location, ... (in the new
	  'queuedata' field). This facility can be used by graphical
	  frontends. Now foomatic-configure also supports to be called
	  unser different names and to load the default spooler choice
	  from a file.

2001-07-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Restructured all queue setup functions, now
	  it is possible with all the spoolers to modify queues by only
	  supplying the items which are changed on the foomatic-configure
	  command line. One can even delete the description or location
	  entries or switch from a queue with driver to a raw
	  queue. Default settings for options do not get lost when one
	  changes the driver and the new driver has options with the same
	  name. Also option settings done with the "native" tools of CUPS
	  and PDQ do not get lost on any kind of manipulation done with
	  foomatic-configure. Extra Perl datablob files removed to avoid
	  problems with maintaining redundant data repositories. Datablobs
	  are now in the main config files (they were already there for
	  CUPS and LPD/LPRng, for PDQ they are addad now. Output of
	  datablobs for frontends will be done by a special command line
	  option. The query functions are cleaned up now.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added Perl datablob to the PDQ datafiles,
	  added a line break to the end of all "die" and "warn" messages
	  to clean the error message output.

2001-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Fixed command line option translation when
	  printing with PDQ (numerical options).

	* foomatic-configure: XML-Combo data in /etc/foomatic is gzipped
	  now (compression factor 10), Perl datablobs with the
	  user-supplied default option settings are stored in
	  /etc/foomatic, too (gzip factor 8). They serve for frontends to
	  get the available options and make it easier to transfer the
	  queues without loss of option settings.
	  Setup function for LPD/LPRng restructured, it allows modifying a
	  queue only supplying the information which changes on the
	  foomatic-configure command line. One can even change the driver
	  and all default settings of options with the same name in the
	  old and the new driver are conserved.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed help page of PDQ (numerical options).
	
2001-07-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Links named "lp", "lpr", "lpq", "lprm", and
	  "lpc" to the foomatic-printjob executable can be made and the
	  program does the action of the appropriate command when called
	  through one of the links, job list ("lpq") output of LPRng
	  filtered so that it comes out in the same form as the job
	  listings of the other spoolers, possibility to save a default
	  spooler.
	
2001-07-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Added all missing job listing and job removal
	  functions. Added functionality for advanced queue and job
	  control. Updated help message.

	* Makefile: Added CUPS commands for queue and job control.

	* makeDefaults: Added CUPS commands for queue and job control.
	
2001-07-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Added job listing (query) and job removal
	  functions for PDQ. Added job listing function for LPD. Added
	  line breaks at the end of all "die" calls so that the line
	  number is not shown when the program executes the appropriate
	  "die",

	* foomatic-configure: Added line breaks at the end of all "die"
	  calls.
	
2001-07-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Coomand line options which are not used by
	  foomatic-printjob are passed to spooler-specific printing
	  command, Support for printing multiple copies with PDQ, printer
	  queue can also be specified with the "-d" option.
	
2001-07-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Exit status of the spooler's printing command
	  is passed back to the user as the exit status of
	  foomatic-printjob, GNU-lpr (VA-Linux) is auto-detected and the
	  options are passed appropriately. Clean-up of the help message
	  (option -h).

	* foomatic-configure: Support for setting default options, help
	  message cleaned up.
	
2001-07-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed backquote from the boolean option
	  example in the PDQ help page. It broke the shell script for
	  printing the page. Preliminary fix for foomatic-configure not
	  exiting when building combo data with the Gimp-Print Foomatic
	  data installed: Flushing memory cache during build after
	  treatment of every option.

	* foomatic-printjob: Fixed option handling,

	* foomatic-configure: Set automatically a search path to
	  /etc/foomatic/pdq into the /usr/lib/pdq/printrc file, so that
	  the Foomatic driver description files are found.
	
2001-07-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: The INSTALLPREFIX facility was broken. Fixed.

	* USAGE: Added user instructions.

	* README: Pointed to new USAGE file

	* sharp.upp: New driver for the Sharp AJ-1800/2000 inkjet printers
	
2001-07-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Added foomatic-printjob to the user programs to be
	  installed
	
2001-07-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Now the combo XML data and not only the
	  printer data is stored in /etc/foomatic for every queue, the
	  "-X" option allows also getting combo data by supplying both a
	  printer and a driver, the logfile for the LPD/LPRng queues,
	  /var/log/lp-errs is touched now when a queue is added, so that
	  it is made sure that it exists.

	* foomatic-printjob, Makefile, makeDefaults: First sketch of
	  foomatic-printjob: Now one has basic printing functionality with
	  options on all spoolers.

2001-06-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure, Makefile, makeDefaults: PDQ support added:
	  Now we have a command-line-based administration interface for
	  PDQ and the basic functionality of foomatic-configure is
	  completed. Fixed bug in help message of foomatic-configure. In
	  LPD "rlpr" is only used for remote LPD queues with filter, for
	  raw queues the "rm" and "rp" tags in the /etc/printcap file are
	  used.
	
2001-06-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added LPRng support (without
	  magicfilter). The support is done by adding the differences
	  between LPD and LPRng in the functions for handling LPD. Fixed
	  autodetection of LPRng (typo).
2001-06-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lpdomatic: Fixed: The documentation page did not show the
	  correct lpr command line example for LPRng and when lpdomatic
	  does not find the printer driver description file (*.lom) it did
	  not put the file name into the error message.

	* Makefile: Removed comment that LPRng is not supported yet.
	
2001-06-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed several bugs in the function
	  getpdqdata(): PostScript/PJL options were not prepended to the
	  job data/the GhostScript output, let the choice names be
	  <option>_<choice> and not only <choice>, because in PDQ one
	  provides only the choice name and not the option name and the
	  choice name on the command line. So options with the same choice
	  names (as "Duplex" and "Manualfeed" on the LaserJet 4050 with
	  "ljet4" driver, which have both "On" and "Off" as choices) are
	  ambiguous, added "docs" option to print documentation page with
	  PDQ, fixed boolean options, they were broken. Text file printout
	  done with "mpage" now.

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic: Fixed bug of "This option corresponds to
	  a PJL command" not appearing on documentation page (option
	  "docs").
	
2001-06-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Query function for CUPS, corrected bug in
	  function dump_config where the <queue ...> tag was closed by
	  </foomatic>, fixed query function for LPD, so that it supports
	  all backend types, remote LPD printing under LPD done with
	  "rlpr".

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added /etc/cups/printers.conf.
	
2001-06-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for adding/modifying and removing
	  CUPS queues (for all backends supported by CUPS).
	
	* cupsomatic: Parsing of options embedded in the document
	  fixed. For accessing the value of an enumerated option $avalue
	  instead of $value was used, so the values read into $value were
	  not inserted into the option list. Search the first 1000 lines
	  for options because after polling the PJL options from a printer
	  or with a PostScript printer with many features in its PPD file
	  the 100 lines can easily be exceeded.

	* lpdomatic/cupsomatic (common part): The support of PJL option is
	  marked by the existence of the "pjl" key in the Perl data set of
	  the printer/driver combo. So "if (defined($dat->{'pjl'}))" and
	  not "if ($dat->{'pjl'})" has to be asked to check PJL support.
	
2001-06-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for adding CUPS queues (all queue
	  types supported by "lpadmin"). Bugfixes in queue setup for LPD:
	  Make directories before the backend script for raw queues is
	  written to there, Rename old $etcfile and $etcxfile also when
	  one sets up a raw queue.
	
	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Set default paths and file names for CUPS,
	  let cupsomatic be installed in the CUPS filter directory.

2001-06-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Now one can configure all types of
	  LPD queues automatically: local USB/parallel, remote 
	  LPD/SMB/Socket. In addition one can define a queue which pipes the
	  output into an arbitrary command or a raw queue. Bugfix: Removed
	  colon after "q" (="quiet") in "getopts()" line. Introduced "-f"
	  (="force") flag of foomatic-datafile.

	* lpdomatic (bugfix): In lpdomatic the
	  prepending of PJL options is suppressed for non-PJL printers.

	* Makefile (bugfix): Added foomatic-*pjloptions, moved
	  foomatic-configure to admin programs. Fixed links of the pcache
	  and compiled directories in /var/cache/foomatic to
	  /usr/local/share/foomatic/db, before the printer combo was always
	  recompiled.
	
2001-06-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefiles: Allowed the possibility to install the Perl libs with
	  another prefix than the rest of the files. So installation is also
	  possible when Perl does not search for libraries in /usr/local.
	
2001-06-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Bugfixes: foomatic-configure could not delete queues, makeDefaults
	  set a wrong path for lpdomatic, Makefile missed a "make" in
	  the process of installing the Perl libraries.
	
2001-06-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* PJL options can be added to the Foomatic data now:
	  foomatic-getpjloptions retrives them from the printer,
	  foomatic-addpjloptions generates XML datasets from them.
	
2001-04-01  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Various renaming has happened.  Instead of 'PHTDBPUB', it's
	  Foomatic::DB.  Foomatic::Defaults exports the libdir et al into
	  you, and the flock of companion modules represent other mostly
	  internal code.
 
	* Rearranged all the code; now there's a proper Perl module, in
	  theory at least, in Foomatic/, and the toplevel Makefile
	  supports this.  There's also 'make testing', for a run-in-place
	  setup.

2001-03-14  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Minor updates to reflect website postgres->xml conversion.

2001-03-10  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Added section="??" attribuge to arg_postscript.  Now it's clear
	  where the Postscript snippets should be placed in the document.
	  OTOH, the filters haven't even absorbed Crutcher's DocumentSetup
	  patch, nevermind support for other locations.  And JCL still
	  isn't handled.  Or ppd constraints.  Or queries.  Etc.

	* Fixed Till's bug wrt empty options being left out.  Also fixed a
	  few other subtle bugs in ppd parser and foo option generator.

	* Small updates to Makefile; it might work again.  Note that it
	  modifies the scripts in place before installing, which will
	  cause confusion if you attempt further work in place.

	* Added foomatic-kitload, which imports source data subsets into
	  the local data library.

2001-03-07  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Various additional checks and things when doing combo ops in
	  hopes of avoiding horribly mysterious error messages.

	* Implemented foomatic-ppdload.  It might even work(tm).

2001-03-06  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Made dump_db strip out illegal constraints, and implemented
	  comments filtering.  Only <p> and <a> are allowed now.  <br> is
	  mapped into <p>.

	* New snap of Postgres database

	* Make install should(tm) now do something sensible.  It still
	  ought to autodetect "flavor" for foomatic-configure.

	* Rename make-datafile to foomatic-datafile.

	* Wrap f-c -Q output in <queues> to make it have one toplevel
	  entity.

2001-03-04  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Removed constraints entirely from combo data.  So arg_defval now
	  appears at /option/arg_defval instead of at
	  /option/constraints/constraint/arg_defval.

	* Switch verified tag to an unverified tag.  Eventually, the xml
	  dataset will be defined as containing only verified information,
	  so this way there's one less tag for maintainers to fiddle with.

	* Prepare for CVS integration.

	* Various minor twiddles around the website programs.

	* args_byname twiddle for Till.

	* Include all the backends in the package.
	
2001-02-28  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

        * Require Storable
        
	* Added printer autodetect sections to overview.  Use xpath or
	  similar to see the values in /printer/autodetect/parallel
	
	* -Q in foomatic-configure; prints XML summary of system printer
	  configuration.  -X and -O allow examination of the whole
	  database.  f-c API should now be sufficient to build GUIs atop.

	* compile_db changes to limit pain of Perl memory leaks.

	* Added the pcache, a persistent pre-parsed cache of everything.

	* Various buglets from Till.  Invalid constraints just warn, don't
	  hose the whole option.  Etc.

	* Add foomatic-configure; initial LPD support.

	* Various typos and minor fixes; the overview compile/save was
	  broken, and the overview Perl was missing the driver list.

	* Begin beta3.

2001-02-25  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Added methods get_makes, get_javascript2, get_models_by_make,
	  get_printer_from_make_model.

	* Added overview support.  Various methods now return or use the
	  overview infromation; the overview is just a summary listing of
	  various database-wide info.  By using it, many operations are
	  less horribly slow.  The overview is db/compiled/overview.xml

	* Don't actually need XML::Grove::PerlSAX.

	* Added -f clag to compile_db, and extra work avoidance code.

	* Fixed variable naming bug in pdq generator, and fixed boolean
	  option conversion in getdat.

2001-02-25  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@habanero.picante.com>

	* Included an experimental dataset from the new data generation
	  code I've written for gimp-print.  The driver "stp-4.1.5" might
	  even work(tm).

2001-02-20  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@habanero.picante.com>

	* Subtle adjustments to <constraint> contents.	The <sense>
	  element is gone; replaced with the sense="true" or sense="false"
	  attribute on the <constraint> tag itself.  Also, you can now
	  specify a <printer>printer-id</printer> element instead of
	  make/model; this is useful for automatically generated data.
