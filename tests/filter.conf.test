# This file allows you to configure the "foomatic-rip" filter.
# Uncomment the lines where you want to do a change and enter
# the desired value.

# plug a security loophole by explicitly specifying a default
# value for TMPDIR, used by GhostScript to create temporary
# files.  This should not be necessary in any security minded
# print spooler such as CUPS or LPRng, where the TMP directory
# is set.  This setting is especially important when you are
# using file converters and they may need to create ENORMOUS
# temporary files.  For example, a PPD file must be seekable.

TMPDIR: /tmp

# Command for converting non-PostScript files (especially
# text) to PostScript. Supported commands are "a2ps",
# "enscript" or "mpage".  Command line options will be
# automatically set by "foomatic-rip".  If you do not specify
# a full pathname foomatic-rip will search for one using the
# PATH environment value.

# textfilter: a2ps

# enabledebug must be set to 1 to allow debugging and tracing
# 'debug' can be used to set the debug level.
# The debug level is actually used as a bit vector; each
# bit enables a corresponding set of debugging statements.
# See the foomatic-rip documentation for details.
# 'logfile' specifies the prefix of the logfile name.  Thus
# "/tmp/foomatic-rip" will generate /tmp/foomatic-rip.log.  If
# there is XX in the name, then a temporary file a la the UNIX
# mktemp system call will be created.  The input sent to the
# renderer process will be put in /tmp/foomatic-rip.ps.

logfile: /tmp/foomatic-rip
enabledebug: 1
# debug: 0

# gspath - path and options passed to gs (Ghost Script)
# use this when you need to explicily specify the path

# gspath: gs

# Set the PATH value to be used by foomatic-rip and its
# children processes

# execpath: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

# CUPS only:

# Set ps_accounting to 0 to suppress inserting postscript code for
# accounting.
# ps_accounting: 1
