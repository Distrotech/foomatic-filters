Foomatic 2.9.0
==============

foomatic-filters
----------------

Filter scripts used by the spoolers to convert the incoming PostScript
data into the printer's native format using a printer/driver specific
PPD file (now there are still spooler-specific printer/driver description
files but in the future spooler-independent PPD files will be used).

Do not use this package in production environments, it can contain
severe bugs or even be non-functional.

See the README file of "foomatic-db-engine" for a (more or less)
complete overview of Foomatic.

Programs and important files from this package
----------------------------------------------

It is planned to modify the filter scripts so that they all work with
PPD files and even with non-Foomatic PPD files as they come with
PostScript printers. Then spooler-specific printer/driver description
files will not be needed any more. This package does not require any
other Foomatic package. it can be used with printer/driver description
files/PPDs downloaded from linuxprinting.org or in the future also with
non-Foomatic PPDs.

Note: The scripts appear as ".in" files in the source tree and CVS,
because the path for the Perl interpreter/the bourne shell is inserted
by the "configure" script. For the filters there are ".pl.in" files in
the "src" directory. The "configure" script makes ".pl" files from
them with the inserted path of the Perl interpreter. The Makefile sets
up the headers of the ".pl" files dependent on whether a regular
installation or an "in-place" installation is done generating the
final files in the main directory.

configure.ac

  The source from which GNU autoconf generates the "configure" script

acinclude.m4

  Additional macros for the "configure" script

make_configure

  Calls aclocal and autoconf to generate "configure" from "configure.ac" 
  and "acinclude.m4"

Makefile.in

  The template from which "configure" generates the Makefile

install-sh

  Helper script for "configure"

lpdomatic

  Runs under LPD, VA's GNUlpr LPD variant, LPRng, and probably others.
  Currently uses a plain Perl dump of the old-style combo data as
  input.

cupsomatic

  Runs under CUPS.  The datafile is a Perl dump of the old-style combo
  data embedded as comments at the end of an automatically generated
  PPD.  The PPD reflects all the options, numerical options are mapped to
  enumerated options. Some GUIs (KDE 3.x, XPP 1.1 and newer) show the
  numerical options as numerical options anyway.

ppromatic

  Runs under PPR.  The datafile is a Perl dump of the old-style combo
  data embedded as comments at the end of an automatically generated
  PPD.  The PPD reflects all the options, numerical options are mapped to
  enumerated options.

pdqomatic

  Not actually a standalone program at this time.  Rather, the
  Foomatic::DB code directly generates PDQ driver declaration with
  embedded shell script code to implement everything needed.

mfomatic

  Runs under magicfilter, mainly for LPRng use.  A derivative of this
  is used by Red Hat (?).  Takes the old-style Perl dump as input.
  Works together with a slightly modified magicfilter; code here
  generates magicfilter definitions that process ascii properly and
  pipe Postgres into mfomatic.  mfomatic is probably broken. I (Till)
  never tested this, and in reality it is not needed. When one has
  "a2ps" installed, one can print many different file types on a printer
  set up with lpdomatic.

directomatic

  Filter for printing directly to the printer, without any spooler,
  uses the same plain Perl dump as lpdomatic as input.

foomatic-gswrapper

  This is not really a backend filter, but it is used by all backend filters
  when it is present. This is a wrapper around Ghostscript. It regularizes 
  options if they differ between gs flavors. The filter scripts auto-detect
  the presence of foomatic-gswrapper.


Dependencies
------------

To build and run this package only a Perl interpreter (5.6.0 and
newer) is needed.

To connect to remote printers, you need additional connectivity
software (as "rlpr", "nc", "smbspool', ...).
