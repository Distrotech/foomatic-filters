.SH NAME
directomatic \- Print without spooler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI directomatic\ \-P \ <printdef>\  [\fB-J\fR\ \fIjobtitle\fR ]
[\fB-o\fR \fIoption\fB=\fIvalue\fR [...]] [\fIfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Directomatic is a filter script to print with free software printer
drivers without the need of a print spooler.  It is designed to be used
together with a Foomatic printer definition file.

.SS Options
.TP 10
.BI \-P \ <printdef>
where printdef is the printer definition file to use.
.TP 10
.BI \-J \ <jobtitle>
where job title will be printed in the head line of every page of a plain
text job.
.TP 10
.BI \-o \ option\fB=\fIvalue
Set an arbitrary option.
.TP 10
.BI file
The file to print.


.SS Commands
\fBDirectomatic\fR will print from standard input unless a file to
print is specified on the command line.
If your printer definition file is in \fI@$ENV{'FOO_ETC'}@/direct\fR
or \fI~/.foomatic/direct\fR you do not need to specify its path.  Put a
'$postpipe = "| ..."' line into the printer definition file
(instructions in the file) to redirect the output of directomatic to
your printer instead of standard output. To make normal users able to
print this way add them to group \fBlp\fR and make sure the
appropriate printer device file \fI/dev/lpX\fR is group-writable.
