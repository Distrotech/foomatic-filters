foomatic-filters for Debian
---------------------------

Note that the structure of the OpenPrinting (foomatic) printer
configuration system in Debian (and upstream) has changed from the 2.0
series.  There are now 3 core packages:

* foomatic-db: Contains the foomatic printer database.

* foomatic-db-engine: Contains the foomatic-configure script.

* foomatic-filters (this package): Contains the filter scripts for
  various backend printing systems.

In addition, the new foomatic-db-hpijs package includes the database
entries for printers supported by the HPIJS print filter developed by
Hewlett-Packard for its consumer inkjet line of printers.

The foomatic-bin package is provided for upgrade purposes from
Foomatic 2.0, and can be purged after its dependencies have been
installed.
