Please read the README and USAGE files for details.

DEFAULT (/usr/local/...) INSTALLATION

The following instructions will install foomatic-rip files in:

  /usr/local/bin/foomatic-rip
  /usr/local/etc/foomatic/filter.conf
  /usr/local/lib/{spooler associated directories}
  /usr/local/man/man1/foomatic-rip.1

  a)  if you do not have a configure file in the source
    directory do:
     sh make_configure
  b)  Now do the standard configure/make/make install:
     ./configure
     make
     make -n install (and check to make sure these
                      are the right locations)
     make install

   Note: existing filter.conf file will be renamed as
    file.conf.bak

NON-DEFAULT (/usr, /etc, ...) LOCATIONS

If you need to specify different locations, then use:
   configure --help
to find the options to specify file locations.

The following instructions will install foomatic-rip files in:

  /usr/bin/foomatic-rip
  /etc/foomatic/filter.conf
  /usr/lib/{spooler associated directories}
  /usr/man/man1/foomatic-rip.1

  a)  if you do not have a configure file in the source
    directory do:
     sh make_configure
  b)  Now do the standard configure/make/make install:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
     make
     make -n install (and check to make sure these
                      are the right locations)

     make install

   See the STANDARD_configuration file.  You can edit this
   and put in the appropiate locations, and then do:

   sh STANDARD_configuration
   make install

REALLY NONSTANDARD INSTALLATION

Copy the files by hand.  Sorry.

  a)  if you do not have a configure file in the source
    directory do:
     sh make_configure
  b)  Now do the standard configure/make/make install:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
     make

  c) edit foomatic-rip to have the correct default
     location for filter.conf and then copy it
     to the desired destination and make sure it has
     executable permissions:
     vi foomatic-rip

     install -c -m 755 foomatic-rip /destination/directory/

     OR

     cp foomatic-rip /destination/directory/
     chmod 755 /destination/directory/foomatic-rip 

  d) copy filter.conf to the desired destaion
     install -c -m 644 filter.conf /destination/directory/

DEBUGGING ENABLED

   By default, the trace and debugging facility is disabled
due to its very high overhead in time and space.  To enable this
facilty, use 'make debug' after configuration:

      ./configure
      make debug
      make installl
