# This is a little Ghostscript regularization script.  It massages
# arguments to make Ghostscript execute properly as a filter, with
# output on stdout and errors etc on stderr.

# Arbitrary other option processing could happen here, too.

# IT WOULD BE WRONG to have this file do any processing of the input
# or output data.  Such job transforms belong in actual filters, or
# inside Ghostscript itself.
